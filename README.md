# Enrichment of LCR annotations in protein families
LCRs are usually observed as short fragments of the whole protein sequence. To analyze how functional annotations of LCRs are related to a general protein function, we analyzed enrichment of LCR annotations in InterPro families.
This method was implemented to asses usability of LCRAnnotationsDB. 

# Technologies
Project is created with Python3.6 and several packages to download data to analysis and run statistic tests (see file requirements.txt).

## Setup and run
This project was implemented in linux dystrybution and we present only setup with pip package. To run this analysis, run following steps:

1. Install Python
 $ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.6 
2. Install requirements
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run analysis
