# Enrichment of LCR annotations in protein families
LCRs are usually observed as short fragments of the whole protein sequence. To analyze how functional annotations of LCRs are related to a general protein function, we analyzed enrichment of LCR annotations in InterPro families.
This method was implemented to asses usability of LCRAnnotationsDB.
